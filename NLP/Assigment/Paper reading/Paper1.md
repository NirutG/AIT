| **Challenge**        | They present a textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that can translate speech from one language into another language and can be built without the need of any text data. 1. Modeling multispeaker target speech 2. Train the system with real-world S2ST data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

3. Speech normalization technique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Solution**         | Self-supervised unit-based speech normalization technique with finetunes a pre-train speech encoder with paired audios from multiple speakers and a single reference speaker to reduce  the variations due to accents, while preserving the lexical content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Results**          | 1. Textless S2ST, S2ST with supervised data - First, compared with the basic setup, the baseline with target speaker embedding can give  a1.2.2 BLEU improvement on three language pairs  2. Analysis on the speech normalizer - norm-unit from a speech normalizer finetuned on 1-hr data achieves similar WER as orig-unit, indicating that the normalization process does not change the content of the speech.  3. Analysis of mined data - Each pair of aligned speech in the mined data has an associated semantic similarity score. |
| **Conclusion**       | A textless S2ST system can be trained with real target speech data. The key to the success is a self-supervised unit-based speech normalization process, which reduces variations in the mult- speaker target speech while retaining the lexical content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Future work**      | They plan to investigate more textless approaches to improve model performance such as self- supervised pre-training. All the experiments and ASR evaluation are conducted with publicdatasets or open-sourced models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
